# First Portfolio
![Home Page](./src/Images/RepoImages/portfolio1.png)    

My first attempt at a professional portfolio site.

## Motivation
I was inspired to make a simple single page application. I used a clean and modern black and white design. All information is contained on one single page so there was no need for a router.

The website is in its final form. Except for an occasional update as bugs are encountered, this will not be updated further.

## Features
Features include a responsive image carousel, a navbar that autoscrolls to a selected project, responsive mobile design, and project data stored in json format.
